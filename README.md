Project Name: Bus Tracking System

**********************************************************************************
File Structure:

main.cpp: Contains the main function and user interface for interacting with the Bus Tracking System.
bus.cpp: Implements functions related to bus operations, such as adding, searching, deleting, and displaying bus information.
bus.h: Header file defining the Bus class and function prototypes used in bus.cpp.
test.cpp: Contains unit tests for testing various functionalities of the Bus Tracking System.
Makefile: Configuration file for compiling the source code and generating executable files.

**********************************************************************************
Installation:

Clone the repository from Bitbucket link. (Note: The reader has read access only; modifications cannot be made directly to the repository.)
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Run 'make' command to compile the source code and generate the executable files.
Execute the main executable (bustracking) to interact with the Bus Tracking System.
Terminal Command = ./bustracking

**********************************************************************************
Usage:

Upon running the main executable, users are presented with a menu to perform various operations such as adding a bus, searching for a bus, displaying available buses, and deleting bus information.
The system prompts users to input their choice and provides instructions accordingly.
Unit tests can be executed by running the test executable (testbus), which verifies the functionality of the Bus Tracking System.
Terminal Command = ./testbus
